# Js-test-task

All files for test task are placed in **./src** folder at the root of the project.

There are three different folders with appropriate scripts.

You can run them both from *Node.js* env and *Client side (Browser)*

To start work with them, you can just copy and paste in **console tab** in your browser dev tools.

Or you can clone the repository and run it **from Node.js** environment assuming you are at the root of the project:
```
node ./src/<dirname>/<filename>
```

#Note: In changeElements.js file there are two solutions using both ES5 and ES6 syntax.
#Note: If you want to run bind.js script from node.js platform, you should read the file and comment out the soulution for browser as alert() isn't supported by Node.js, then you will use console.log.
